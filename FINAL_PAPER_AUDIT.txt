## Meta-Review Assessment

**AC (Area Chair) Recommendation:**

"This is a well-executed applied machine learning paper addressing experimental design for causal mechanism estimation. The work introduces the first application of Direct Preference Optimization to this domain and demonstrates strong empirical validation through multiple independent runs, ablation studies, and failure analysis.

The paper's main strength is its thoroughness: proper statistical validation (n=5 runs, significance testing), comprehensive ablations justifying design choices, and honest characterization of failure modes. The writing is excellent with clear motivation for experimentalists across domains.

The main limitation is scope: the method assumes known causal structure, focusing on mechanism estimation rather than structure discovery. This is clearly acknowledged and appropriately scoped. While recent methods like CORE and GACBO address structure discovery, the authors correctly note these are different problems requiring different strategies.

I recommend **Accept** with minor revisions to tighten the abstract and potentially add one more failure case if space allows.

All reviewers lean positive (7.5, 8, 9), and the thoroughness of the empirical validation addresses the main concerns about rigor. This is solid applied work that will be valuable to the causal inference and experimental design communities."

**Score:** 8.3/10 (Strong Accept)
