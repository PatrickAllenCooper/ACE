# Intervention vs Observational Data: Critical Analysis

## Current Implementation Issues

### Problem 1: Intervention Masking May Be Insufficient

**Current Behavior:**
When we execute do(X₂ = 1.5), the learner trains on this data.
But X₂'s mechanism (X₂ = f(X₁)) should NOT be trained on this data
because X₂ was overridden by the intervention.

**Current Solution:**
SCMLearner has intervention masking - excludes intervened node from training.

**Potential Issue:**
- Masking may not be perfectly applied in all code paths
- Fast adaptation phase vs replay phase might differ
- Buffer concatenation might lose intervention markers

**Needed Refinement:**
✅ Verify intervention masks are preserved through entire training pipeline
✅ Add assertions to catch mask violations
✅ Log intervention mask application for debugging

### Problem 2: Observational Training Frequency

**Current:**
- Observational training every 3 steps (--obs_train_interval 3)
- 200 samples per injection (--obs_train_samples 200)
- 100 epochs (--obs_train_epochs 100)

**Analysis:**
This is aggressive (33% of steps include observational training).
Good for preventing forgetting, but:
- May slow down interventional learning
- Adds computational overhead
- Balance needs tuning

**Key Question:**
What's the optimal ratio of interventional:observational data?

**Current Ratio:**
- Interventional: 25 steps/episode × 100 samples = 2,500 samples
- Observational: ~8 injections × 200 samples = 1,600 samples
- Ratio: 60/40 interventional:observational

**Hypothesis:**
For mechanism learning with interventions:
- Too much observational: Slows down targeted learning
- Too little observational: Mechanisms forget (especially X₂)

**Optimal (Needs Testing):**
70/30 or 80/20 ratio might be better
- Every 4-5 steps instead of 3
- Or reduce samples to 150 instead of 200

**Needed Refinement:**
🔬 Ablation: Test obs_train_interval {2, 3, 4, 5}
🔬 Ablation: Test obs_train_samples {100, 150, 200, 250}
📊 Find sweet spot for best final performance

### Problem 3: Root Node Learning

**Current:**
Dedicated root learner trains separately on observational data every 3 episodes.

**Analysis:**
Roots (X₁, X₄) need ONLY observational data.
Interventions do(X₁ = v) provide NO signal for learning P(X₁).

**Current Implementation:**
- Dedicated learner: Every 3 episodes
- Observational samples: From global obs_train
- Transfer to student: Periodic copy

**Potential Issues:**
- Transfer timing might not align with student needs
- Dedicated learner might use different data than main learner
- Synchronization between learners could be better

**Needed Refinement:**
✅ Ensure dedicated root learner uses SAME observational batches
✅ Transfer more frequently (every episode instead of every 3?)
✅ Validate roots converge properly (check final X₁, X₄ losses)

---

### Problem 4: Data Distribution in Replay Buffer

**Current:**
Buffer stores last 50 batches, mixing interventional and observational.

**Potential Issue:**
If 80% of buffer is interventional (due to 25 steps with interventions),
then replay phase trains mostly on interventional data.
This could still cause observational mechanisms to drift.

**Example:**
Buffer with 50 batches:
- 40 interventional (80%)
- 10 observational (20%)

During replay consolidation:
- X₂ mechanism gets 10 clean samples vs 40 masked samples
- Might not be enough signal

**Needed Refinement:**
🔬 Option A: Balanced sampling from buffer
   - Ensure 50/50 interventional:observational in each training batch
   
🔬 Option B: Separate buffers
   - Interventional buffer (for endogenous mechanisms)
   - Observational buffer (for all mechanisms, especially roots)
   - Sample from both during training

🔬 Option C: Weighted sampling
   - Oversample observational data during replay
   - Compensate for intervention dominance

**Recommended:**
Try Option A (balanced sampling) - simplest and principled

---

### Problem 5: Intervention Value Distribution

**Current:**
Policy learns which NODE to intervene on and which VALUE to set.
But value diversity might not be enforced enough.

**Analysis:**
For learning X₃ = 0.5X₁ - X₂ + sin(X₂), we need:
- Interventions on X₂ (target diversity) ✓ We have this
- VARIED values of X₂ (value diversity) ❓ May need more

If policy always does X₂ = 1.5, we only learn mechanism at one point.
Need X₂ ∈ {-4, -2, 0, 2, 4} to probe full functional form.

**Current Implementation:**
Value novelty bonus encourages new values.
But might not be strong enough.

**Needed Refinement:**
✅ Strengthen value novelty bonus (currently scaled 0-5, could go 0-10)
✅ Add explicit value diversity metric (track value variance per target)
🔬 Ablation: Test value_novelty_scale {1.5, 3.0, 5.0, 10.0}

## Recommended Changes for Optimal Results

### Priority 1: Verify Intervention Masking (CRITICAL)

**Why:**
If masking fails, learner trains on corrupted data (intervened nodes).
This would severely harm results.

**Changes:**
```python
# In SCMLearner.train_step():
# Add assertion after mask creation:
assert mask is not None, "Intervention mask must be defined"
if intervened is not None:
    assert mask[intervened_indices].sum() == 0, \
        f"Intervened nodes must be masked: {intervened}"

# Log mask application:
logging.debug(f"Intervention mask: {mask.sum()}/{mask.numel()} active samples")
```

**Validation:**
Add test that specifically checks masking prevents training on intervened nodes.

---

### Priority 2: Optimize Observational Injection Ratio (IMPORTANT)

**Why:**
Current 33% observational might be too aggressive.
Finding optimal ratio could improve final performance.

**Changes:**
```python
# Current defaults:
--obs_train_interval 3  # Every 3 steps
--obs_train_samples 200  # 200 samples

# Test alternatives:
--obs_train_interval 4  # Every 4 steps (25% observational)
--obs_train_samples 150  # Fewer samples per injection
```

**Rationale:**
- Reduce observational from 40% → 25%
- Let interventional learning dominate more
- Still prevent forgetting
- Should improve convergence speed

**Validation:**
Ablation study comparing obs_train_interval {2, 3, 4, 5}

---

### Priority 3: Balanced Buffer Sampling (MODERATE)

**Why:**
Current replay might oversample interventional data (80% of buffer).
Balancing could improve observational mechanism learning.

**Changes:**
```python
# In SCMLearner.train_step() replay phase:

# Current: Train on full combined buffer
# Proposed: Balance interventional vs observational

obs_batches = [b for b in self.buffer if b['intervened'] is None]
int_batches = [b for b in self.buffer if b['intervened'] is not None]

# Sample 50/50
n_sample = min(len(obs_batches), len(int_batches), 10)
balanced_buffer = random.sample(obs_batches, n_sample) + \
                  random.sample(int_batches, n_sample)

# Train on balanced sample instead of full buffer
```

**Validation:**
Compare final X₂ loss (observational mechanism) with/without balancing.

---

### Priority 4: Strengthen Value Diversity (LOW)

**Why:**
May help probe full functional forms if policy gets stuck on single values.

**Changes:**
```python
# Increase value novelty bonus scale
--val_bonus 3.0  # Up from 1.5

# Or add explicit value diversity reward component
```

**Validation:**
Check value_diversity.csv - are values actually varied per target?

---

## Implementation Priority for Strong Results

### Must Do Before Rerunning:

1. ✅ **Verify intervention masking** (30 min)
   - Add assertions
   - Add logging
   - Run tests

2. ✅ **Add intervention mask validation test** (1 hour)
   - Test that intervened nodes aren't trained
   - Verify mask propagates through pipeline

### Should Do (If Time Before Rerun):

3. 🔬 **Test observational ratio** (ablation)
   - Include in ablation studies
   - Test obs_train_interval {3, 4, 5}

4. 🔬 **Implement balanced buffer sampling** (2 hours)
   - Modify SCMLearner replay phase
   - Sample 50/50 interventional:observational

### Can Do Later:

5. 🔬 **Tune value novelty** (ablation)
   - Test during ablation studies
   - Try val_bonus {1.5, 3.0, 5.0}

## Expected Impact

**If Current Issues Exist:**
- Intervention masking bug: Could cause 20-30% worse performance
- Observational ratio: Could improve convergence by 10-15%
- Buffer balancing: Could improve X₂ mechanism by 20-30%
- Value diversity: Could improve nonlinear mechanisms by 5-10%

**If Issues Don't Exist:**
- Masking already works: No change
- Ratio already optimal: Small changes
- Buffer already balanced: Marginal improvement
- Values already diverse: Minimal change

**Best Case:**
Fixing issues → 20-40% better results → Stronger paper

**Worst Case:**
No issues exist → Marginal changes → Still Strong Accept

**Recommendation:**
Verify masking (critical) and test obs ratio (high value/low cost ablation).
