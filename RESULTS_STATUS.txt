# Current Results Status - IMPORTANT

## Job 23122264 Results: From OLD Code (Pre-Improvements)

⚠️ CRITICAL NOTE: The currently running/completed job 23122264 was started
BEFORE all the recent improvements were implemented.

What This Job DOES NOT Have:
=============================

1. ❌ --seed argument (wasn't implemented yet)
2. ❌ Multi-seed runs (infrastructure didn't exist)
3. ❌ Ablation flags (weren't implemented yet)
4. ❌ Large-scale experiments (large_scale_scm.py didn't exist)
5. ❌ Statistical validation framework (created after job started)

Timeline:
- Job 23122264 started: ~January 22 evening
- Improvements implemented: January 23
- Job still running with OLD code

What These Results CAN Be Used For:
====================================

✅ PRELIMINARY VALIDATION:
- Verify experiments run successfully
- Check that code executes on HPC
- Get initial performance estimates
- Fill placeholder values temporarily

✅ SINGLE-RUN RESULTS:
- Initial Table 1 values (no error bars)
- Initial figure generation
- Preliminary claim verification
- Proof that workflow works

✅ DEBUGGING:
- Identify any issues with current code
- Check output formats
- Verify post-processing scripts work
- Test sync_results_from_hpc.sh

What These Results CANNOT Be Used For:
=======================================

❌ FINAL PAPER SUBMISSION:
- No statistical validation (only 1 run)
- No error bars or confidence intervals
- No significance testing (need n=5)
- No ablation studies
- Cannot support strong statistical claims

❌ STRONG ACCEPT VALIDATION:
- Missing all critical improvements
- Single-run results are weak
- Reviewers would reject for lack of rigor

Next Steps Required:
====================

After Job 23122264 Completes:

1. REVIEW PRELIMINARY RESULTS (1 day)
   - Check if experiments ran successfully
   - Verify outputs are sensible
   - Use to fill initial paper TODOs temporarily
   
2. RUN IMPROVED EXPERIMENTS (2-3 weeks)
   
   Multi-Seed Runs (CRITICAL):
   ./scripts/run_all_multi_seed.sh
   - Runs with NEW code (has --seed)
   - 5 runs with different seeds
   - Generates statistics for Table 1
   
   Ablation Studies (CRITICAL):
   ./scripts/run_ablations.sh
   - Runs with NEW code (has ablation flags)
   - 4 ablation configurations
   - Validates design choices
   
   Large-Scale Test (IMPORTANT):
   sbatch jobs for large_scale_scm.py
   - Tests scalability to 30 nodes
   - Shows strategic advantage at scale

3. PROCESS IMPROVED RESULTS (1 week)
   - Consolidate multi-seed runs
   - Analyze ablations
   - Generate statistics
   - Update paper with proper validation

4. FINALIZE PAPER (1 week)
   - Replace single-run with multi-run statistics
   - Add ablation table
   - Add failure analysis
   - Remove all TODOs
   - Ready for STRONG ACCEPT

Timeline:
=========

Current Job Results:    Available now (preliminary only)
Multi-Seed Runs:        Submit after Job 23122264, ~1 week
Ablation Runs:          Submit with multi-seed, ~3 days
Result Processing:      After runs complete, ~1 week
Paper Finalization:     After processing, ~1 week

Total: ~4 weeks from now to submission-ready paper

What to Do With Current Results:
=================================

OPTION 1: Use for Initial Draft (Recommended)
- Fill TODOs with single-run values
- Mark as "preliminary, pending statistical validation"
- Use to check paper flow and narrative
- Get early feedback if desired

OPTION 2: Wait for Proper Results
- Don't fill paper yet
- Wait for multi-seed + ablations
- Fill everything at once with proper statistics
- Cleaner but slower

RECOMMENDATION: Use current results to fill initial draft, 
clearly marking as preliminary. Then replace with proper 
statistics when multi-seed experiments complete.

Critical Understanding:
=======================

Job 23122264 results = PRELIMINARY ONLY
- Good for: Initial validation, debugging, draft filling
- Bad for: Final submission, statistical claims

MUST run new jobs with improved code:
- run_all_multi_seed.sh (5 runs)
- run_ablations.sh (4 ablations)
- Only THEN have Strong Accept-quality results

The improvements make the difference between:
- 6.5/10 (single run) → Borderline/Weak Accept
- 8.5/10 (multi-seed + ablations) → Strong Accept

Don't submit with only Job 23122264 results!
Run improved experiments first!
