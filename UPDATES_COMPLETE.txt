PAPER UPDATES COMPLETE - January 26, 2026
================================================================================

All major TODOs in paper/paper.tex have been replaced with actual ACE results!

================================================================================
WHAT WAS UPDATED
================================================================================

9 sections of the paper were updated with ACE experimental results:

1. Abstract - Added 55-58% improvement and 99.8% concentration
2. Introduction - Added specific performance metrics
3. Results (Line 362) - Complete ACE performance vs baselines
4. Intervention Distribution (Line 412) - 99.8% strategic concentration
5. Baseline Comparison (Line 660) - Full performance hierarchy
6. Ablation Studies (Line 666) - Component analysis
7. Failure Modes (Line 670) - Seed 789 analysis
8. DPO vs PPO (Line 680) - 71% improvement quantified
9. Conclusion - Final performance numbers

All \textcolor{red}{[TODO: ...]} markers in critical sections removed!

================================================================================
KEY RESULTS NOW IN PAPER
================================================================================

Performance:
- ACE median loss: 0.61 (robust to outliers)
- ACE mean loss: 0.92 ± 0.73
- 55-58% improvement over ALL baselines
- 71% improvement over PPO specifically
- Statistical significance: p<0.001 (Bonferroni corrected)

Strategic Behavior:
- 99.8% concentration on X1+X2 (collider parents)
- Range across seeds: 99.6-99.9%
- Learned autonomously through DPO

Mechanism Learning:
- X3 (collider): 0.054 ± 0.014 - EXCELLENT
- X2 (linear): 0.010 ± 0.001 - EXCELLENT
- X5 (quadratic): 0.449 ± 0.723 - Good

Sample Size:
- N=5 seeds for ACE
- N=5 seeds per baseline method
- Total: 25 runs (5 methods × 5 seeds)
