- **NeurIPS/ICML**: Accept/Strong Accept (empirically rigorous)
- **ICLR/AISTATS**: Strong Accept (excellent applied work)
- **UAI/AAAI**: Strong Accept (novel + rigorous)

2. ✅ **Well-Motivated** - Concrete examples from biology, materials, neuroscience
3. ✅ **Real Gap** - Addresses non-stationary rewards in active learning
4. ✅ **Multiple Domains** - Synthetic, physics (Duffing), economics (Phillips)
5. ✅ **Comprehensive Baselines** - Random, Round-Robin, Max-Variance, PPO
6. ✅ **Practical Innovations** - Per-node convergence, dedicated root learner
7. ✅ **Current Related Work** - 16 new citations (2023-2025), ironclad
8. ✅ **Reproducible** - Code available, 77% test coverage, automated workflow

## Critical Weaknesses (8 Major Gaps)

1. ❌ **No Theory** - Pure application, no sample complexity/regret bounds
2. ❌ **No Statistical Validation** - Single runs, no error bars or confidence intervals  
3. ❌ **No Ablation Studies** - Cannot justify why each component is necessary
4. ❌ **Limited Scale** - Only 5-15 nodes (real systems have 100s of variables)
5. ❌ **Assumes Known Graph** - Major limitation acknowledged but not addressed
6. ❌ **No Failure Analysis** - Only shows successes, not when/why it fails
7. ~~Missing Recent Baselines~~ - NOT APPLICABLE (CORE/GACBO solve structure discovery, we solve mechanism estimation - different problems)
8. ❌ **Heavily Synthetic** - Only Phillips uses real data (and historical, not live)

## Detailed Component Scores

### Novelty: 6/10
- Application of existing method (DPO) to new domain
- Practical innovations are incremental
- No new theory or algorithms
**Gap:** Needs theoretical contribution or algorithmic innovation

### Experimental Validation: 5/10
- Good domain coverage
- Multiple baselines
- Missing: statistics, ablations, large scale, failure cases
**Gap:** Needs empirical rigor (error bars, significance tests)

### Impact Potential: 7/10
- Clear applications (drug discovery, materials)
- Addresses pain point (expensive experiments)
- Automated science vision compelling
**Gap:** Needs deployment demonstration

### Writing: 7/10
- Clear motivation
- Good structure
- Terms well-defined
**Gap:** Abstract dense, could be punchier

### Reproducibility: 8/10
- Code available
- Methods detailed
- Test suite comprehensive
**Gap:** Need explicit reproducibility statement in paper

### Related Work: 8/10
- Comprehensive coverage
- Recent (2023-2025)
- Clear positioning
**Strength:** This is solid now

## Path to STRONG ACCEPT (8-9/10)

### CRITICAL (Must Do - ~2 weeks)

**1. Statistical Validation** (+1.0 point)
- Run all experiments 5 times with different seeds
- Add mean ± std to all metrics
- Include error bars in all figures
- Report confidence intervals in Table 1
- Run t-tests for statistical significance

**2. Ablation Studies** (+0.5 points)
- Remove per-node convergence → show performance degrades
- Remove dedicated root learner → show root learning suffers
- Remove diversity reward → show policy collapses
- Show 3-component > complex multi-term rewards

**3. Failure Analysis** (+0.5 points)
- Identify cases where ACE underperforms baselines
- Characterize difficult causal structures
- Show DPO failure modes
- Honest discussion of limitations

**4. Statistical Significance** (+0.5 points)
- Paired t-tests for ACE vs each baseline
- Report p-values in Table 1
- Claims supported by significance

**Total Impact:** 6.5/10 → 9/10 (STRONG ACCEPT)

### IMPORTANT (Should Do - if time)

**5. Recent Method Comparison** (+0.3 points)
- REMOVED: CORE/GACBO solve structure discovery (different problem)
**6. Larger Scale** (+0.4 points)
- Test on 30-50 node networks
- INFRASTRUCTURE READY: experiments/large_scale_scm.py (30-node SCM)
- INFRASTRUCTURE READY: experiments/large_scale_scm.py (30-node SCM)
- INFRASTRUCTURE READY: experiments/large_scale_scm.py (30-node SCM)
- Informal argument for why DPO works
- ADDED: Theoretical justification in paper (Bradley-Terry, scale-invariance)
- ADDED: Theoretical justification in paper (Bradley-Terry, scale-invariance)
- ADDED: Theoretical justification in paper (Bradley-Terry, scale-invariance)
- ADDED: Theoretical justification in paper (Bradley-Terry, scale-invariance)

## Most Critical Missing Piece

**Statistical Validation (No Error Bars)**

Every table, every claim, every "ACE achieves X" statement is based on a SINGLE RUN. This is a major red flag for reviewers. Standard practice in ML is 3-5 runs minimum.

**Current Table 1:**
```
ACE: 1.50 total loss
```

**Should Be:**
```
ACE: 1.50 ± 0.12 total loss (n=5)
```

**Impact on Review:**
- Without: "How do we know this isn't random chance?"
- With: "Results are statistically validated"

**Cost:** ~1 week (rerun experiments 5 times)
**Benefit:** +1.0 point, shifts verdict significantly

## Recommended Action Plan

### Option 1: Quick Improvement (2 weeks → Accept)
1. Run experiments 5 times (1 week of compute)
2. Add error bars everywhere (2 days)
3. Statistical significance tests (1 day)
4. Add 3 ablation studies (2 days)
5. Add failure analysis section (1 day)

**Result:** 6.5/10 → 8/10 (Strong Accept as empirical paper)

### Option 2: Submit As-Is (Risky)
- Fill TODOs with single-run results
- Submit immediately
- Hope reviewers are lenient

**Result:** Likely Borderline/Weak Accept with requests for:
- Multiple runs
- Statistical validation
- Ablations

Then need to do Option 1 for revision anyway.

### Option 3: Major Revision (1 month → Top-Tier)
- Everything in Option 1
- Add theoretical analysis
- Larger scale experiments
- Real experimental validation

**Result:** 6.5/10 → 9/10 (Top-tier Strong Accept)

---

## Bottom Line

**Current State:** Well-written application paper with solid engineering

**Honest Assessment:** 6.5/10 (Borderline/Weak Accept)

**Missing:** Empirical rigor that top venues expect

**Easiest Path to Strong Accept:**
Run experiments 5 times, add error bars, do ablations, analyze failures
(~2 weeks additional work → 8/10)

**Your paper has good bones - it just needs statistical validation to be strong.**
