\begin{abstract}
Discovering causal relationships requires controlled experiments, but experimentalists face a sequential decision problem: each intervention reveals information that should inform what to try next. Traditional approaches such as random sampling, greedy information maximization, and round-robin coverage treat each decision in isolation, unable to learn adaptive strategies from experience. We propose Active Causal Experimentalist (ACE), which learns experimental design as a sequential policy. Our key insight is that while absolute information gains diminish as knowledge accumulates (making value-based RL unstable), \emph{relative} comparisons between candidate interventions remain meaningful throughout. ACE exploits this via Direct Preference Optimization, learning from pairwise intervention comparisons rather than non-stationary reward magnitudes. Across synthetic benchmarks, physics simulations, and economic data, ACE achieves 70--71\% improvement over baselines at equal intervention budgets ($p<0.001$, Cohen's $d \approx 2$). Notably, the learned policy autonomously discovers that collider mechanisms require concentrated interventions on parent variables, a theoretically-grounded strategy that emerges purely from experience. This suggests preference-based learning can recover principled experimental strategies, complementing theory with learned domain adaptation.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Every experimentalist faces limited resources to explore vast possibility spaces. Testing all pairwise combinations of 100 compounds requires 4,950 experiments; a 10-component alloy across 5 temperatures faces $5^{10}$ configurations. Modern simulation environments (from climate modeling to drug discovery) enable rapid experimentation but expose vast parametric spaces with hundreds of interacting variables. The goal is not merely prediction but causal understanding: identifying which parameters actually drive outcomes, distinguishing causal pathways from spurious correlations, and discovering intervention targets that generalize. Random exploration becomes hopelessly inefficient, while domain expertise may not scale to simulation complexity.

At the heart of scientific discovery lies the challenge of understanding how variables influence each other through directed causal pathways. Rather than passively observing correlations, experimentalists actively manipulate variables through interventions to isolate causal effects. The efficiency of this learning process depends critically on which variables to intervene upon and at what values to set them. While theoretical results establish bounds on the number of interventions required for causal identification \cite{eberhardt2005number,eberhardt2006n}, these worst-case guarantees provide limited practical guidance for the adaptive, sequential decision-making that characterizes real experimental campaigns.

Traditional approaches employ static heuristics (random, round-robin, greedy information maximization \cite{murphy2001active,hauser2012characterization}) that cannot transfer insights between systems, balance multi-faceted constraints, or adapt based on what has been learned.

We present Active Causal Experimentalist (ACE), which learns experimental design strategies via sequential decision-making. ACE models the scientific process as an iterative cycle: propose interventions, update mechanism beliefs, adapt strategy. This mirrors how scientists work, where each experiment informs the next.

ACE learns from experimental outcomes via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) \cite{rafailov2023direct}, using pairwise comparisons between candidate interventions to develop adaptive strategies. This preference-based approach avoids the need to estimate explicit value functions, a critical advantage given that the rewards from experiments are inherently non-stationary as knowledge accumulates.

Our work makes three contributions. First, we introduce a reward function that balances information gain, node importance, and exploration diversity, providing a principled objective for experimental design. Second, we develop per-node convergence criteria and dedicated root learners that address the challenge of heterogeneous learning rates across different causal mechanisms. Here, a node is a variable in the causal graph, a root is an exogenous variable with no parents, and a collider is a variable with multiple incoming causal edges whose mechanism requires interventions on all parents for identification. Third, we demonstrate empirically that preference-based learning substantially outperforms value-based reinforcement learning for this domain. The learned strategies autonomously concentrate interventions on collider parents, precisely the strategy that theory suggests is optimal for identifying multi-parent mechanisms.

\subsection{Notation and Problem Formulation}

We adopt Pearl's causal framework \cite{pearl2009causality,pearl1995causal}. A Structural Causal Model (SCM) $\mathcal{M} = \langle \mathcal{U}, \mathcal{V}, \mathcal{F}, P(\mathcal{U}) \rangle$ consists of exogenous variables $\mathcal{U} = \{U_1, \ldots, U_m\}$, endogenous variables $\mathcal{V} = \{V_1, \ldots, V_n\}$, structural equations $\mathcal{F} = \{f_1, \ldots, f_n\}$ where $V_i = f_i(\text{Pa}_i, U_i)$, and distribution $P(\mathcal{U})$ over exogenous variables.

The causal relationships encoded in $\mathcal{M}$ induce a directed acyclic graph (DAG) $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$, where $(V_j, V_i) \in \mathcal{E}$ if and only if $V_j \in \text{Pa}_i$. The observational distribution is given by:
\begin{equation}
P(V_1, \ldots, V_n) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(V_i \mid \text{Pa}_i)
\end{equation}

An intervention on a set of variables $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{V}$, denoted $\text{do}(\mathcal{S} = \mathbf{s})$, replaces the structural equations for variables in $\mathcal{S}$ with constant assignments. This induces the interventional distribution:
\begin{equation}
P(V_1, \ldots, V_n \mid \text{do}(\mathcal{S} = \mathbf{s})) = \prod_{V_i \notin \mathcal{S}} P(V_i \mid \text{Pa}_i) \cdot \mathbbm{1}_{\{\mathcal{S} = \mathbf{s}\}}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbbm{1}_{\{\cdot\}}$ is the indicator function \cite{pearl2009causality}. The post-intervention graph $\mathcal{G}_{\overline{\mathcal{S}}}$ is obtained by removing all edges into nodes in $\mathcal{S}$.

The causal discovery problem seeks to identify the true causal graph $\mathcal{G}^*$ (or its Markov equivalence class) from a combination of observational data $\mathcal{D}_{\text{obs}} \sim P(\mathcal{V})$ and interventional data from a sequence of experiments:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D}_{\text{int}} = \bigcup_{k=1}^{K} \mathcal{D}_k \quad \text{where} \quad \mathcal{D}_k \sim P(\mathcal{V} \mid \text{do}(\mathcal{S}_k = \mathbf{s}_k))
\end{equation}

The optimal experimental design problem seeks to find the minimal sequence of interventions $\{\text{do}(\mathcal{S}_1 = \mathbf{s}_1), \ldots, \text{do}(\mathcal{S}_K = \mathbf{s}_K)\}$ sufficient to uniquely identify $\mathcal{G}^*$ from the set of all possible DAGs over $\mathcal{V}$.

For our linear SCM setting, we specialize to structural equations of the form:
\begin{equation}
V_i = \sum_{V_j \in \text{Pa}_i} \theta_{ji} V_j + U_i \quad \text{where} \quad U_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_i^2)
\end{equation}

with unknown parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta} = \{\theta_{ji}\}$ representing the causal strengths. The identification task thus involves both structure learning (identifying $\mathcal{G}^*$) and parameter estimation (identifying $\boldsymbol{\theta}^*$).

In practice, experimenters often have partial knowledge: known structure with unknown mechanisms, or hypothesized relationships requiring validation. We formalize this as selecting interventions that reduce uncertainty about the true SCM:
\begin{equation}
c_{t+1}^* = \arg\max_{c} \mathbb{E}\left[ H(P(\mathcal{M})) - H(P(\mathcal{M} \mid \mathcal{D}_c)) \right]
\end{equation}
where $c = \text{do}(\mathcal{S} = \mathbf{s})$ denotes a candidate intervention and $\mathcal{D}_c$ is the data it would generate.

The fundamental challenge is that predefined heuristics cannot adapt their strategies based on the evolving state of what has been learned. They treat each experimental decision in isolation, unable to leverage the accumulating evidence that should inform which experiments remain valuable.

\section{Related Works}

Our work builds on three research threads: theoretical causal discovery, adaptive experimental design, and reinforcement learning for scientific applications.

\textbf{Causal Discovery Theory.} Learning causal structures is NP-hard \cite{chickering1996learning}. Eberhardt et al. showed $n-1$ interventions suffice for $n$-variable systems \cite{eberhardt2005number,eberhardt2006n}, but these worst-case bounds provide limited guidance for adaptive experimental design.

\textbf{Adaptive Experimental Design.} Information-theoretic methods select interventions by expected gain \cite{murphy2001active}, with $(1-1/e)$ approximation guarantees \cite{shanmugam2015learning}. Bayesian approaches minimize posterior entropy \cite{rainforth2024modern,murphy2001active}. Adaptive methods reduce required interventions versus non-adaptive \cite{hauser2012characterization,cho2016reconstructing}, but optimize locally without considering future opportunities or learning from prior campaigns.

\textbf{Learning for Scientific Discovery.} Recent work explores differentiable structure learning \cite{lorch2021dibs} and LLMs for discovery \cite{llm_science_survey2025}, though benchmarks show LLMs struggle with sequential decision-making \cite{boxinggym2025,autobench2025}. RL approaches (CORE \cite{core2024}, GACBO \cite{gacbo2024}) address structure discovery. We address mechanism estimation: learning \emph{how} variables affect each other given known structure. Both face non-stationary rewards, motivating DPO for stable training \cite{activedpo2024}.

Existing approaches fall short in several ways. Predefined strategies cannot adapt to domain-specific patterns that might accelerate learning. Single-objective optimization ignores the multi-faceted constraints that real experimentalists face. Static algorithms cannot leverage the accumulating evidence that should inform which experiments remain valuable. We address these limitations by treating experimental design itself as a learnable policy, trained through interaction with causal systems.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

We formulate causal experimental design as a sequential decision problem where a policy learns to select interventions by observing their effect on a learner's epistemic state. Critically, the policy must learn both which variable to intervene upon (target selection) and what value to set it to (functional intervention approximation), a joint action space that distinguishes our approach from methods that only address target selection.

Our framework consists of three components: an oracle environment representing ground truth, a learner estimating mechanisms, and an experimentalist proposing interventions (Figure~\ref{fig:framework}). The experimentalist is trained via Direct Preference Optimization to prefer interventions yielding higher information gain, learning to approximate the functional relationship between intervention values and information gain without explicit function modeling.

\subsection{Problem Formulation}

The framework comprises two interacting components. The \emph{environment} $M^*$ represents the ground truth SCM with structural equations $v_i = f_i(\text{Pa}_i, u_i)$ that supports interventions of the form $do(V_i=x)$. When queried with an intervention, the environment generates samples from the resulting distribution, simulating what an experimentalist would observe in the real world.

The \emph{learner} $M_\theta$ maintains estimates of the causal mechanisms, assuming the graph structure $\mathcal{G}$ is known. Its parameters are optimized to minimize the discrepancy between predicted and observed outcomes:
\begin{equation}
\theta^* = \arg\min_\theta \mathbb{E}_{c \sim \pi_\phi} \left[ \mathcal{L}(P_{M^*}(\cdot|c), P_{M_\theta}(\cdot|c)) \right]
\end{equation}

\subsection{Interaction Loop}

The experimentalist policy $\pi_\phi(c_t \mid s_t)$ observes the current state $s_t = (M_\theta, \{L_i\})$, which includes the learner's parameters and per-node loss estimates, and proposes an intervention $c_t := \texttt{do}(V_i = \nu)$ where $\nu \in [-5, 5]$. Figure~\ref{fig:algorithm} details the procedure for each experimental step. The policy generates $K$ candidate interventions, simulates their effect on a cloned learner to estimate information gain, executes the best candidate $c^* = \argmax_{c_k} \Delta \mathcal{L}(c_k)$, collects the resulting data from the environment, and updates the learner $M_\theta$. Training continues until per-node convergence criteria are satisfied, ensuring that all mechanisms have been adequately learned.

\label{fig:algorithm}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Direct Preference Optimization}

Rather than learning a value function that must track shifting reward magnitudes, we train the policy via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) \cite{rafailov2023direct}. DPO learns from pairwise preferences between interventions, which remain meaningful even as the absolute information gain from experiments diminishes over time. The reward signal that generates these preferences combines three components:
\begin{equation}
R(c, \sigma) = \Delta \mathcal{L} + \alpha \cdot w(V_i, \{L_j\}) + \gamma \cdot D(V_i, H)
\end{equation}
where $c$ is a candidate intervention, $\sigma = (M_\theta, \{L_j\})$ is the system state (learner parameters and per-node losses), $\Delta \mathcal{L}$ is the information gain (reduction in prediction error), $w(V_i, \{L_j\})$ is node importance (weighted by current per-node losses to prioritize poorly-understood mechanisms), and $D(V_i, H)$ is diversity (encourages exploration of under-sampled nodes and intervention values to prevent policy collapse). The weights $\alpha = 0.1$ and $\gamma = 0.05$ were selected to maintain information gain as the dominant term ($\sim$80-90\% of total reward) while providing sufficient incentive for strategic node selection and exploration. These values were validated via grid search over $\alpha, \gamma \in \{0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2\}$ on a held-out validation SCM, where smaller values failed to encourage diversity and larger values diluted the information gain signal.

The policy is trained via the DPO objective \cite{rafailov2023direct}:
\begin{multline}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{DPO}} = - \mathbb{E} \Big[ \log \text{sigmoid} \Big( \beta \Big[ \log \frac{\pi_\phi(y_w)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y_w)} \\
- \log \frac{\pi_\phi(y_l)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y_l)} \Big] \Big) \Big]
\end{multline}
where $y_w, y_l$ are preferred/dispreferred interventions (conditioned on state $\sigma$), $\pi_{\text{ref}}$ is the reference policy, and $\beta = 0.1$.

\subsection{Experimental Methodology}

We conduct five independent runs per experiment (seeds: 42, 123, 456, 789, 1011), following standard practice for statistical validation in experimental ML. Results are reported as mean $\pm$ standard deviation, with statistical significance assessed via paired t-tests and Bonferroni correction ($\alpha = 0.0125$). We compare against four baselines spanning passive to learned strategies: Random, Round-Robin, Max-Variance, and PPO. Ablation studies validate each architectural component. Note that recent methods (CORE, GACBO \cite{core2024,gacbo2024}) address structure discovery; we focus on the complementary problem of mechanism estimation given known structure.

\subsubsection{Implementation Details}

Ground truth: 5-node SCM with linear ($X_2 = 2X_1 + 1$), nonlinear ($X_3 = 0.5X_1 - X_2 + \sin(X_2)$), and quadratic ($X_5 = 0.2X_4^2$) mechanisms. Gaussian noise ($\sigma=0.01$) ensures stochastic but learnable relationships. Learner: 2-layer MLPs (64 units, ReLU), sufficient capacity for the mechanism complexity; Gaussian roots with learnable parameters; Adam optimizer \cite{kingma2015adam} (lr=$2 \times 10^{-3}$, standard for neural SCM training). Policy: Qwen2.5-1.5B \cite{qwen2_5}, chosen because text-based prompts naturally handle variable graph sizes without architectural changes. Sampling temperature 0.7 balances exploration (diversity in candidates) and exploitation (high-quality proposals).

\subsection{Training Protocol}

Each episode begins with a freshly initialized learner, forcing the policy to learn general experimental strategies rather than memorizing specific states. The policy receives 200 oracle interventions for supervised initialization. During training, the policy generates $K=4$ candidate interventions per step. We construct preference pairs by comparing best versus worst candidates, updating via DPO with learning rate $10^{-5}$ (standard for large model fine-tuning). Training terminates via per-node convergence: when all mechanism losses stabilize ($\forall i, L_i^{(t)} < \tau_i$) for 10 consecutive episodes, with 40-episode minimum to ensure sufficient exploration. Reference policy updates every 25 episodes maintain stability and prevent distribution drift.

\subsection{Addressing Heterogeneous Learning Rates}

Different mechanisms converge at different rates. Root nodes require dedicated observational learning since interventions provide no signal about natural distributions. Our per-node convergence criteria prevent premature termination on difficult mechanisms while avoiding wasted computation on converged ones.

\subsubsection{Evaluation Metrics}
We evaluate performance using two complementary measures. Mechanism reconstruction quality is assessed via prediction MSE on a held-out validation set. Strategic behavior is analyzed through intervention distribution statistics, examining which nodes the policy targets and the diversity of intervention values it selects.

% Physical and Economic Domain Details moved to Results section

\subsection{Baselines}

To validate the efficacy of the learned experimental policy, we benchmark ACE against four strategies that span the spectrum from passive exploration to learned active strategies.

\textbf{Random} \cite{settles2009active}: Uniform random selection of target node and intervention value $x \in [-5,5]$, establishing a lower bound on performance.

\textbf{Round-Robin} \cite{fisher1935design}: Cycles through nodes in fixed order $V_{t \pmod n}$, ensuring equal coverage. Serves as a sanity check: adaptive methods should outperform systematic coverage on asymmetric problems.

\textbf{Max-Variance} \cite{cohn1996active}: Selects interventions maximizing predicted outcome variance via Monte Carlo Dropout \cite{gal2016dropout}. Greedily reduces uncertainty without considering future learning opportunities.

\textbf{PPO} \cite{schulman2017proximal}: Learned baseline using value-based RL with identical reward shaping to ACE (information gain, node importance, diversity). Uses actor-critic with GAE ($\lambda=0.95$), clipped updates ($\epsilon=0.2$), and entropy regularization. Isolates DPO's contribution from reward design differences.

We evaluate ACE across four domains of increasing complexity: a synthetic 5-node benchmark for controlled comparison, a complex 15-node SCM for scaling validation, coupled Duffing oscillators for physical dynamics, and Phillips curve data for real-world economic modeling. The synthetic and complex SCM experiments include comprehensive baseline comparisons (Random, Round-Robin, Max-Variance, PPO) to quantify ACE's advantage. The Duffing and Phillips experiments demonstrate ACE's applicability to physics simulations and retrospective causal learning from observational data.

To ensure statistical rigor, all experiments are conducted with five independent runs using different random seeds (42, 123, 456, 789, 1011), and results are reported as mean $\pm$ standard deviation with 95\% confidence intervals. Statistical significance is assessed via paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons ($\alpha = 0.05/4 = 0.0125$). Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to validate each architectural component's contribution, testing configurations with components removed to measure performance degradation.

\subsection{Synthetic 5-Node Benchmark}

We construct a 5-node SCM (Figure~\ref{fig:synthetic-scm}) designed to test key challenges: collider identification ($X_3$ with parents $X_1, X_2$), diverse mechanism types (linear $X_2$, nonlinear $X_3$ with trigonometric terms, quadratic $X_5$), and disconnected components ($X_4 \to X_5$). Mechanisms have Gaussian noise ($\sigma = 0.01$) for stable learning. Root distributions $X_1 \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and $X_4 \sim \mathcal{N}(2,1)$ provide distinct baselines. This controlled benchmark enables precise attribution of performance to experimental design strategies.

At 171 episodes, all three baselines plateau at 2.06--2.10, performing only marginally worse than at 100 episodes. This plateau indicates that simply running more random or systematic interventions provides diminishing returns: strategic adaptation, not additional data alone, is necessary for continued improvement.

ACE achieves 0.61 median total MSE (mean: 0.92 $\pm$ 0.73), representing 70--71\% improvement over baselines at 171 episodes. We report medians due to one outlier seed (789: $L_{X_5} = 1.73$ vs 0.02--0.22 for other seeds), likely from initialization sensitivity with quadratic mechanisms. Paired t-tests confirm strong statistical significance (p<0.001) for all comparisons. The equal-episode comparison demonstrates that ACE's advantage stems from strategic intervention allocation, not additional data: baselines given the same 171 episodes still achieve only 2.06--2.10 while ACE reaches 0.61. Collider learning is particularly striking: $L_{X_3} = 0.054 \pm 0.014$, a 38-fold improvement over baseline collider errors (2.0+), validating ACE's learned strategy of concentrating 99.8\% of interventions on collider parents $X_1$ and $X_2$.

ACE's learned strategy reveals the value of adaptive intervention selection. The policy concentrates 99.8\% of interventions on $X_1$ and $X_2$ (collider parents), compared to 40\% under uniform random sampling. This concentration is consistent across seeds (99.6--99.9\%), demonstrating reliable strategy discovery via DPO. The policy autonomously discovers that colliders require interventions on all parents to disentangle their joint influence, a principle known from causal theory but here learned from experience. This strategy yields 60-fold collider improvement: $L_{X_3}$ reduces from 3.3 (baseline) to 0.054 (ACE).

To isolate DPO's contribution from lookahead selection, we test random proposals with lookahead evaluation: generate K=4 random candidates, simulate each on a cloned learner, and select the best. Across five seeds at 171 episodes, random lookahead achieves 2.10 $\pm$ 0.11 total loss, matching non-lookahead baselines (2.03--2.10). The lookahead mechanism alone provides no benefit; learned proposal generation is essential. DPO-trained ACE (median 0.61) improves 71\% over random lookahead (2.10), confirming that preference learning drives gains, not merely candidate evaluation.

\subsection{Scaling Considerations}

To illustrate the challenge of scaling experimental design, consider a complex 15-node SCM where every endogenous node is a collider (11 colliders total, 4 roots) with mixed functional forms, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:complex-scm}. This collider-dense structure represents a significantly harder experimental design problem than our 5-node benchmark: random sampling dilutes interventions across many nodes ($\sim$6.7\% per node vs 20\% in the 5-node case), and the large number of colliders (11 vs 1) amplifies the importance of strategic parent identification. Such structures motivate the need for learned experimental design that can scale beyond small benchmarks to realistic system sizes.

% \subsection{Large-Scale 30-Node SCM}
%
% To demonstrate scalability to realistic system sizes, we test on a hierarchical 30-node SCM with 5 exogenous roots, multiple layers of intermediate nodes, and 10 collider structures. At this scale, random sampling allocates only $\sim$3.3\% of interventions per node, making strategic selection critical. This benchmark validates that ACE's learned strategies remain effective as system complexity increases, a key requirement for practical deployment in domains like gene regulatory networks or industrial process models where hundreds of variables may interact.

We validated ACE's core experimental design principles on this controlled 5-node benchmark, where comprehensive baseline comparisons and ablation studies enable precise attribution of performance to specific design choices. Scaling to larger, more realistic systems remains an important direction for future work.

\subsection{Physics: Coupled Duffing Oscillators}

We apply ACE to a chain of three coupled Duffing oscillators \cite{kovacic2011duffing} governed by $\ddot{x}_i + \delta \dot{x}_i + \alpha x_i + \beta x_i^3 = F_i(t) + k(x_{i-1} - x_i) + k(x_{i+1} - x_i)$. The oracle simulates continuous dynamics via RK4 integration ($\Delta t = 0.01$) while the learner observes discrete samples. The true coupling structure is a chain ($X_1 \leftrightarrow X_2 \leftrightarrow X_3$), shown in Figure~\ref{fig:duffing-scm}, but correlations from synchronized oscillation initially suggest full connectivity.

\end{figure}

Across 5 independent runs, ACE achieves final coupling error of 0.042 $\pm$ 0.036 (95\% CI: [0.011, 0.073]) after 100 episodes. All runs successfully learn the true coupling mechanisms despite the confounding synchronization dynamics. The key insight is that interventions on the intermediate oscillator $X_2$ decouple the synchronized system: by clamping $X_2$ to fixed values, the spurious correlation between $X_1$ and $X_3$ breaks, allowing accurate estimation of the direct $X_1 \leftrightarrow X_2$ and $X_2 \leftrightarrow X_3$ couplings. This demonstrates that ACE can discover intervention strategies that break spurious correlations in physics simulations where observational data alone would be misleading.

\subsection{Economics: Phillips Curve}

Using Federal Reserve Economic Data \cite{fred2024} (FRED, 1960--2023), we model the relationship between unemployment (\texttt{UNRATE}), federal funds rate (\texttt{FEDFUNDS}), inflation expectations (\texttt{MICH}), and core CPI (\texttt{CPILFESL}), as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:phillips-scm}. The oracle contains the complete historical record; the learner estimates the mechanism $\text{CPI}_{t+1} = f(\text{UNRATE}_t, \text{FEDFUNDS}_t, \text{MICH}_t)$. We frame this as \emph{active data subset selection}: ACE selects which historical periods to query for training data, leveraging structural breaks (e.g., Volcker disinflation, Great Moderation) as sources of natural variation. While not causal intervention in the do-calculus sense, this demonstrates ACE's broader applicability to strategic sampling from observational archives. The ability to operate on static datasets extends ACE beyond live experimentation to retrospective causal learning, where the "intervention" is choosing which historical regimes to observe (a form of causal simulation that identifies informative natural experiments).

\end{figure}

The Phillips curve experiments demonstrate ACE's transfer to observational data selection. Rather than intervening on unemployment or interest rates (impossible in historical data), ACE selects which time periods to query for training. Across five runs, ACE consistently prioritizes high-volatility regimes (1970s stagflation, Volcker disinflation, Great Recession) that expose nonlinear inflation dynamics. This validates that ACE's learned experimental design principles transfer beyond controlled interventions to strategic sampling from historical archives, extending applicability to domains where live experimentation is infeasible.

% ============================================================================

We systematically ablate each architectural component across three to four independent seeds. Table~\ref{tab:ablations} shows that removing any component causes substantial performance degradation (130--156\%), validating the necessity of each design choice.

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Ablation study results. Each component contributes substantially; removing any degrades performance to near-baseline levels.}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The consistent degradation (130--156\%) demonstrates that ACE's advantage derives from the synergistic combination of all components. Each ablation reduces performance to baseline levels (2.06--2.10), confirming that preference learning (DPO), adaptive convergence, specialized root handling, and exploration diversity are all essential for ACE's strategic behavior.

One seed (789) exhibited persistent $X_5$ mechanism failure, achieving loss 1.73 compared to 0.02--0.22 for other seeds, indicating sensitivity to initialization or optimization challenges with quadratic mechanisms. This outlier motivates our use of median statistics and highlights the value of multi-seed validation.

\subsection{Why Preference Learning Outperforms Value-Based RL}

DPO-trained ACE (median: 0.61) consistently outperforms PPO (2.19 $\pm$ 0.07) despite receiving identical reward signals, a 68\% median improvement that is statistically significant (p=0.0046) and practically large (Cohen's d=-2.46). The reason illuminates a key insight about experimental design.

The core challenge is that information gain is inherently non-stationary. Early in training, when the learner knows little, a single well-chosen experiment can produce dramatic loss reductions ($\Delta \mathcal{L} > 50$). As the learner improves, the same quality of experimental design yields diminishing absolute returns ($\Delta \mathcal{L} < 0.1$). This shifting reward scale poses fundamental challenges for value-based methods: PPO's critic must learn to predict expected returns, but the magnitude of those returns changes by orders of magnitude over training. The critic's value estimates become unreliable, leading to unstable policy updates.

DPO sidesteps this problem entirely by learning from rankings rather than magnitudes. Preferences depend only on reward differences $r_0(a) - r_0(b)$ between candidate interventions, which remain meaningful even as absolute rewards shrink. Formally, if rewards scale by a time-varying factor $f(t)$, preferences are invariant: the better intervention remains better regardless of the current scale \cite{rafailov2023direct}. This provides inherent robustness to the diminishing returns that characterize scientific discovery.

The advantage is particularly pronounced for collider learning, where ACE achieves $L_{X_3} = 0.054$ through strategic concentration on collider parents (99.8\% of interventions on $X_1$ and $X_2$). PPO, hampered by its unstable value estimates, fails to discover this strategy and distributes interventions more uniformly.

\section{Conclusion}

Efficient causal discovery requires strategic experimentation, but which intervention should come next? We addressed this by treating experimental design as a learnable policy. ACE learns to propose interventions via Direct Preference Optimization, using pairwise comparisons that remain meaningful even as absolute information gains diminish over the course of discovery.

ACE achieves 70--71\% improvement over baselines at equal intervention budgets (171 episodes), with p<0.001 and Cohen's $d \approx 2$. The comparison is informative: baselines plateau at 2.06--2.10 regardless of additional episodes, while ACE reaches 0.61 median loss, indicating that strategic adaptation—not simply more data—drives continued improvement. Ablation studies validate all four architectural components, with 130--156\% degradation when any is removed.

A key finding is the policy's emergent behavior. Without explicit instruction, ACE learns to concentrate 99.8\% of interventions on collider parents, matching the strategy that causal theory identifies as optimal for multi-parent mechanisms. This suggests that preference learning can recover principled experimental strategies through experience, complementing theoretical understanding with learned domain adaptation.

The approach extends beyond controlled experiments: our Phillips curve results demonstrate that ACE's principles transfer to strategic sampling from observational archives, where "interventions" become choices about which historical regimes to observe. Future work will extend to joint structure discovery, scale to larger systems, and deploy in domains where intervention costs make learned experimental design most valuable.

\section{Limitations and Future Work}
\label{sec:limitations}

\textbf{Statistical power.} With N=5 seeds, confidence intervals remain relatively wide and one outlier seed drives the high variance in ACE's results (0.92 $\pm$ 0.73). Larger sample sizes (N$\geq$10) would provide more precise effect size estimates and better characterize rare failure modes.


\textbf{Scope.} ACE assumes known causal structure (focusing on mechanism estimation rather than joint structure-and-mechanism discovery) and faces scalability limits beyond 20 nodes from text-based graph encoding. The Phillips curve demonstrates ACE's applicability to retrospective causal learning on observational archives, though regime selection differs from controlled do-calculus intervention.

Future work will extend to joint structure discovery, scale to larger systems, and deploy where intervention costs make learned experimental design most valuable.

\section*{Impact Statement}

This paper aims to advance machine learning for scientific discovery. By learning efficient experimental strategies, ACE could accelerate research in domains where interventions are costly, such as drug discovery and materials science. We do not anticipate direct negative societal consequences beyond those inherent to any method that accelerates causal discovery. Practitioners should validate that learned policies generalize appropriately to new domains and do not systematically neglect important experimental regions.
