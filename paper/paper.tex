\begin{abstract}
Discovering causal relationships requires running controlled experiments, but experimentalists face a fundamental challenge: which experiment should they run next? Current approaches rely on static heuristics (random sampling, round-robin coverage, or greedy information maximization) that cannot adapt as knowledge accumulates. We propose Active Causal Experimentalist (ACE), a framework that learns experimental design strategies via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Rather than estimating value functions that become unreliable as rewards diminish, ACE learns from pairwise comparisons between candidate interventions, providing stable training under the non-stationary rewards inherent to scientific discovery. We introduce per-node convergence criteria and dedicated root learners to handle the heterogeneous learning rates of different causal mechanisms. Across synthetic benchmarks, physics simulations, and economic data, ACE achieves 52--58\% improvement over all baselines (p<0.01, Bonferroni corrected, Cohen's d $\approx$ 2.2). Remarkably, the learned policy autonomously concentrates 99.8\% of interventions on collider parents, precisely the strategy that causal theory suggests is optimal for multi-parent mechanism identification.

\section{Introduction}

Every experimentalist faces limited resources to explore vast possibility spaces. A molecular biologist choosing which genes to perturb, a materials scientist optimizing alloy composition, or a neuroscientist selecting stimulation targets must answer: which experiment should I run next? Testing all pairwise combinations of 100 candidate compounds requires 4,950 experiments; a 10-component alloy across 5 temperatures faces $5^{10}$ configurations. These combinatorial explosions demand principled intervention strategies.

Modern simulation environments amplify both the opportunity and the challenge. High-fidelity simulators in domains from climate modeling to drug discovery enable rapid, low-cost experimentation that would be impossible in physical systems. Yet these same simulators often expose vast parametric spaces with hundreds or thousands of interacting variables. In such settings, the goal is not merely prediction but causal understanding: identifying which parameters actually drive outcomes, distinguishing genuine causal pathways from spurious correlations, and discovering intervention targets that will generalize beyond the training distribution. Random exploration becomes hopelessly inefficient, while domain expertise may not scale to the complexity of modern simulations.

At the heart of scientific discovery lies the challenge of understanding how variables influence each other through directed causal pathways. Rather than passively observing correlations, experimentalists actively manipulate variables through interventions to isolate causal effects. The efficiency of this learning process depends critically on which variables to intervene upon and at what values to set them. While theoretical results establish bounds on the number of interventions required for causal identification \cite{eberhardt2005number,eberhardt2006n}, these worst-case guarantees provide limited practical guidance for the adaptive, sequential decision-making that characterizes real experimental campaigns.

Traditional approaches to experimental design employ static heuristics: random sampling explores uniformly, round-robin coverage ensures each variable receives attention, and greedy information maximization selects the locally optimal next experiment \cite{murphy2001active,hauser2012characterization}. These methods share critical limitations. They cannot transfer insights from prior experimental campaigns to new but related systems. They optimize single objectives without balancing the multi-faceted constraints that real experimentalists face: cost, time, safety, and estimation quality. Most fundamentally, they cannot adapt their strategies based on what has been learned so far.

We present Active Causal Experimentalist (ACE), a framework that learns experimental design strategies by treating the problem as sequential decision-making. ACE models the scientific process as an iterative cycle: an experimentalist proposes interventions, a learner updates its beliefs about causal mechanisms based on the resulting data, and the experimentalist adapts its strategy based on what was learned. This formulation mirrors the way real scientists work, where each experiment informs the design of the next.

ACE learns from experimental outcomes via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) \cite{rafailov2023direct}, using pairwise comparisons between candidate interventions to develop adaptive strategies. This preference-based approach avoids the need to estimate explicit value functions, a critical advantage given that the rewards from experiments are inherently non-stationary as knowledge accumulates.

Our work makes three contributions. First, we introduce a reward function that balances information gain, node importance, and exploration diversity, providing a principled objective for experimental design. Second, we develop per-node convergence criteria and dedicated root learners that address the challenge of heterogeneous learning rates across different causal mechanisms. Third, we demonstrate empirically that preference-based learning substantially outperforms value-based reinforcement learning for this domain, achieving 52--58\% improvement over all baseline methods with statistical significance (p<0.01, Bonferroni corrected) and large effect sizes (Cohen's d $\approx$ 2.2). Remarkably, the learned strategies autonomously concentrate 99.8\% of interventions on collider parents, precisely the strategy that theory suggests is optimal for identifying multi-parent mechanisms.

\subsection{Notation and Problem Formulation}

We adopt Pearl's causal framework \cite{pearl2009causality,pearl09,pearl95}. A Structural Causal Model (SCM) $\mathcal{M} = \langle \mathcal{U}, \mathcal{V}, \mathcal{F}, P(\mathcal{U}) \rangle$ consists of exogenous variables $\mathcal{U} = \{U_1, \ldots, U_m\}$, endogenous variables $\mathcal{V} = \{V_1, \ldots, V_n\}$, structural equations $\mathcal{F} = \{f_1, \ldots, f_n\}$ where $V_i = f_i(\text{Pa}_i, U_i)$, and distribution $P(\mathcal{U})$ over exogenous variables.

The causal relationships encoded in $\mathcal{M}$ induce a directed acyclic graph (DAG) $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$, where $(V_j, V_i) \in \mathcal{E}$ if and only if $V_j \in \text{Pa}_i$. The observational distribution is given by:
\begin{equation}
P(V_1, \ldots, V_n) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(V_i \mid \text{Pa}_i)
\end{equation}

An intervention on a set of variables $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{V}$, denoted $\text{do}(\mathcal{S} = \mathbf{s})$, replaces the structural equations for variables in $\mathcal{S}$ with constant assignments. This induces the interventional distribution:
\begin{equation}
P(V_1, \ldots, V_n \mid \text{do}(\mathcal{S} = \mathbf{s})) = \prod_{V_i \notin \mathcal{S}} P(V_i \mid \text{Pa}_i) \cdot \mathbbm{1}_{\{\mathcal{S} = \mathbf{s}\}}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbbm{1}_{\{\cdot\}}$ is the indicator function \cite{pearl2009causality}. The post-intervention graph $\mathcal{G}_{\overline{\mathcal{S}}}$ is obtained by removing all edges into nodes in $\mathcal{S}$.

The causal discovery problem seeks to identify the true causal graph $\mathcal{G}^*$ (or its Markov equivalence class) from a combination of observational data $\mathcal{D}_{\text{obs}} \sim P(\mathcal{V})$ and interventional data from a sequence of experiments:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D}_{\text{int}} = \bigcup_{k=1}^{K} \mathcal{D}_k \quad \text{where} \quad \mathcal{D}_k \sim P(\mathcal{V} \mid \text{do}(\mathcal{S}_k = \mathbf{s}_k))
\end{equation}

The optimal experimental design problem seeks to find the minimal sequence of interventions $\{\text{do}(\mathcal{S}_1 = \mathbf{s}_1), \ldots, \text{do}(\mathcal{S}_K = \mathbf{s}_K)\}$ sufficient to uniquely identify $\mathcal{G}^*$ from the set of all possible DAGs over $\mathcal{V}$.

For our linear SCM setting, we specialize to structural equations of the form:
\begin{equation}
V_i = \sum_{V_j \in \text{Pa}_i} \theta_{ji} V_j + U_i \quad \text{where} \quad U_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_i^2)
\end{equation}

with unknown parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta} = \{\theta_{ji}\}$ representing the causal strengths. The identification task thus involves both structure learning (identifying $\mathcal{G}^*$) and parameter estimation (identifying $\boldsymbol{\theta}^*$).

In practice, experimenters often have partial knowledge: known structure with unknown mechanisms, or hypothesized relationships requiring validation. We formalize this as selecting interventions that reduce uncertainty about the true SCM:
\begin{equation}
\text{do}(\mathcal{S}_{t+1} = \mathbf{s}_{t+1}) = \arg\max_{\text{do}(\mathcal{S} = \mathbf{s})} \mathbb{E}\left[ H(P(\mathcal{M} \mid \cdot)) - H(P(\mathcal{M} \mid \cdot, \mathcal{D}_{t+1})) \right]
\end{equation}

The fundamental challenge is that predefined heuristics cannot adapt their strategies based on the evolving state of what has been learned. They treat each experimental decision in isolation, unable to leverage the accumulating evidence that should inform which experiments remain valuable.

\section{Related Works}

Our work builds on three research threads: theoretical causal discovery, adaptive experimental design, and reinforcement learning for scientific applications.

\textbf{Causal Discovery Theory.} Learning causal structures from data is NP-hard in general \cite{chickering1996learning}, yet theoretical work has established important bounds on interventional requirements. Eberhardt and colleagues showed that $n-1$ single-node interventions suffice to identify an $n$-variable system \cite{eberhardt2005number,eberhardt2006n}. While these worst-case bounds establish fundamental limits, they provide limited practical guidance for the adaptive, sequential decision-making that characterizes real experimental campaigns.

\textbf{Adaptive Experimental Design.} Information-theoretic methods select interventions by expected information gain \cite{murphy2001active}, with theoretical guarantees showing $(1-1/e)$ approximation ratios for greedy selection \cite{shanmugam2015learning}. Recent Bayesian approaches frame the problem as minimizing posterior entropy over causal structures \cite{bayesian_oed_causal2023,causally_informed_active2023}, while optimization perspectives have emerged that cast experimental design as a structured decision problem \cite{experimental_design_optimization2024}. Adaptive methods that leverage previous experiments achieve substantial reductions in required interventions, sometimes 40--60\% fewer than non-adaptive approaches \cite{hauser2012characterization,cho2016reconstructing}. However, these methods optimize locally at each step without considering how current decisions affect future experimental opportunities, and they cannot adapt to system-specific characteristics that might be learned from prior campaigns.

\textbf{Learning for Scientific Discovery.} Recent work explores differentiable approaches to structure learning \cite{lorch2021dibs} and the use of large language models for scientific discovery \cite{llm_science_survey2025,llm_scientific_method2025}. However, benchmarks suggest that LLMs struggle with the sequential decision-making required for experimental design \cite{boxinggym2025,autobench2025,agentexpt2024}. Reinforcement learning approaches have shown promise for structure discovery: CORE \cite{core2024} and GACBO \cite{gacbo2024} learn policies for determining which edges exist in a causal graph, with related work on variable-agnostic exploration \cite{vacerl2024} and hierarchical causal RL \cite{hierarchical_causal_rl2025,causal_rl_survey2025}. Our work addresses the complementary problem of mechanism estimation: learning \emph{how} variables affect each other given a known or hypothesized structure. Both settings face the challenge of non-stationary rewards as the learner improves, motivating our use of DPO, which provides more stable training than value-based RL under evolving reward distributions \cite{dpo_survey2024,active_dpo2024,activedpo2024}.

Existing approaches fall short in several ways. Predefined strategies cannot adapt to domain-specific patterns that might accelerate learning. Single-objective optimization ignores the multi-faceted constraints that real experimentalists face. Static algorithms cannot leverage the accumulating evidence that should inform which experiments remain valuable. We address these limitations by treating experimental design itself as a learnable policy, trained through interaction with causal systems.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

We formulate causal experimental design as a sequential decision problem where a policy learns to select interventions by observing their effect on a learner's epistemic state. Critically, the policy must learn both which variable to intervene upon (target selection) and what value to set it to (functional intervention approximation), a joint action space that distinguishes our approach from methods that only address target selection.

Our framework consists of three components: an oracle environment representing ground truth, a learner estimating mechanisms, and an experimentalist proposing interventions (Figure~\ref{fig:framework}). The experimentalist is trained via Direct Preference Optimization to prefer interventions yielding higher information gain, learning to approximate the functional relationship between intervention values and information gain without explicit function modeling.

\subsection{Problem Formulation}

The framework comprises two interacting components. The \emph{environment} $M^*$ represents the ground truth SCM with structural equations $v_i = f_i(\text{Pa}_i, u_i)$ that supports interventions of the form $do(V_i=x)$. When queried with an intervention, the environment generates samples from the resulting distribution, simulating what an experimentalist would observe in the real world.

The \emph{learner} $M_\theta$ maintains estimates of the causal mechanisms, assuming the graph structure $\mathcal{G}$ is known. Its parameters are optimized to minimize the discrepancy between predicted and observed outcomes:
\begin{equation}
\theta^* = \arg\min_\theta \mathbb{E}_{c \sim \pi_\phi} \left[ \mathcal{L}(P_{M^*}(\cdot|c), P_{M_\theta}(\cdot|c)) \right]
\end{equation}

\subsection{Interaction Loop}

The experimentalist policy $\pi_\phi(c_t \mid s_t)$ observes the current state $s_t = (M_\theta, \{L_i\})$, which includes the learner's parameters and per-node loss estimates, and proposes an intervention $c_t := \texttt{do}(V_i = \nu)$ where $\nu \in [-5, 5]$. Figure~\ref{fig:algorithm} details the procedure for each experimental step. The policy generates $K$ candidate interventions, simulates their effect on a cloned learner to estimate information gain, executes the best candidate $c^* = \argmax_{c_k} \Delta \mathcal{L}(c_k)$, collects the resulting data from the environment, and updates the learner $M_\theta$. Training continues until per-node convergence criteria are satisfied, ensuring that all mechanisms have been adequately learned.

\label{fig:algorithm}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Direct Preference Optimization}

Rather than learning a value function that must track shifting reward magnitudes, we train the policy via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) \cite{rafailov2023direct}. DPO learns from pairwise preferences between interventions, which remain meaningful even as the absolute information gain from experiments diminishes over time. The reward signal that generates these preferences combines three components: information gain $\Delta \mathcal{L}$ (how much does this intervention reduce uncertainty?), node importance $w(V_i, \{L_j\})$ (how poorly is this mechanism currently understood?), and diversity $D(V_i, H)$ (how different is this intervention from recent history?):
\begin{equation}
R(c, s) = \Delta \mathcal{L} + \alpha \cdot w(V_i, \{L_j\}) + \beta \cdot D(V_i, H)
\end{equation}

The policy is trained to prefer interventions that yield higher rewards using the DPO objective:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{DPO}}(\pi_\phi) = - \mathbb{E}_{(s, y_w, y_l)} \left[ \log \sigma \left( \beta \log \frac{\pi_\phi(y_w \mid s)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y_w \mid s)} - \beta \log \frac{\pi_\phi(y_l \mid s)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y_l \mid s)} \right) \right]
\end{equation}

\subsection{Experimental Methodology}

To ensure robust evaluation, we conduct five independent runs per experiment using different random seeds (42, 123, 456, 789, 1011). We report results as mean $\pm$ standard deviation with 95\% confidence intervals, and assess statistical significance via paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each architectural component. We compare against four baselines (Random, Round-Robin, Max-Variance, and PPO) that span the spectrum from passive exploration to learned active strategies. We note that recent methods like CORE and GACBO \cite{core2024,gacbo2024} address the distinct problem of structure discovery rather than mechanism estimation.

\subsubsection{Implementation Details}

The ground truth environment implements a 5-node SCM with diverse mechanism types: a linear relationship ($X_2 = 2X_1 + 1$), a nonlinear mechanism with trigonometric terms ($X_3 = 0.5X_1 - X_2 + \sin(X_2)$), and a quadratic relationship ($X_5 = 0.2X_4^2$), all with additive Gaussian noise ($\sigma=0.01$).

The learner parameterizes each mechanism using a neural network with 2 hidden layers of 64 units and ReLU activations; root node distributions are modeled as Gaussians with learnable mean and variance. All networks are trained via Adam with learning rate $2 \times 10^{-3}$, performing 100 gradient steps per incoming data sample.

The experimentalist policy is implemented using Qwen2.5-1.5B \cite{qwen2.5}, a language model that generates intervention proposals from prompts encoding the graph structure, current per-node losses, and recent intervention history. We use temperature 0.7 to balance exploration and exploitation in candidate generation.

\subsection{Training Protocol}

Each training episode begins with a freshly initialized learner, forcing the policy to develop generalizable experimental strategies rather than memorizing specific system states. Before DPO training, the policy is initialized via supervised pretraining on 200 interventions selected by an oracle teacher that has access to the true mechanisms.

During each experimental step, the policy generates $K=4$ candidate interventions. We construct preference pairs by comparing the best and worst candidates according to their simulated information gain, then update the policy via DPO with learning rate $10^{-5}$ and temperature parameter $\beta=0.1$. To prevent distribution drift, we update the reference policy every 25 episodes.

Training employs per-node early stopping: the episode terminates when all per-node losses fall below their respective thresholds ($\forall i, L_i^{(t)} < \tau_i$) for 10 consecutive episodes. We enforce a minimum of 40 episodes to ensure sufficient exploration before convergence checks begin.

\subsection{Addressing Heterogeneous Learning Rates}

A key challenge in causal mechanism learning is that different mechanisms converge at different rates. Root nodes present a particular difficulty: since interventions sever incoming edges, intervening on a variable provides no information about its natural distribution when it acts as a root. Our solution is a dedicated root learner trained exclusively on observational data, with its estimates transferred to the main model.

Beyond roots, mechanisms exhibit heterogeneous learning rates depending on their functional form. Linear mechanisms like $X_2 = 2X_1 + 1$ typically converge within 5--10 episodes, while more complex relationships like the quadratic $X_5 = 0.2X_4^2$ may require 40--50 episodes. Our per-node convergence criteria ensure that training continues until all mechanisms are adequately learned, preventing premature termination that would leave difficult mechanisms underfit.

\subsubsection{Evaluation Metrics}
We evaluate performance using two complementary measures. Mechanism reconstruction quality is assessed via prediction MSE on a held-out validation set. Strategic behavior is analyzed through intervention distribution statistics, examining which nodes the policy targets and the diversity of intervention values it selects.

% Physical and Economic Domain Details moved to Results section

\subsection{Baselines}

To validate the efficacy of the learned experimental policy, we benchmark ACE against four strategies that span the spectrum from passive exploration to learned active strategies.

\textbf{Random Sampling} \cite{settles2009active} provides the fundamental baseline for any active learning system: uniform random selection of both target node $V_i$ and intervention value $x \in [-5,5]$. While naive, random sampling has proven surprisingly effective in high-dimensional spaces where strategic selection may overfit to spurious patterns. This baseline represents what an experimentalist would achieve without any domain knowledge or adaptive strategy, establishing a lower bound on performance.

\textbf{Round-Robin} implements systematic experimental design in the tradition of Fisher \cite{fisher1935design}, cycling through nodes in a fixed topological order $V_{t \pmod n}$. This deterministic heuristic guarantees that every mechanism receives equal experimental attention, preventing the neglect of any variable. Round-Robin proves particularly effective for symmetric structures where all nodes are equally important or equally difficult to learn, and serves as a sanity check: any adaptive method that cannot outperform systematic coverage on asymmetric problems offers questionable value.

\textbf{Max-Variance} implements uncertainty sampling \cite{cohn1996active}, the dominant paradigm in pool-based active learning. At each step, we select the intervention maximizing predicted outcome variance: $c^* = \arg\max_c \sum_{V_j} \text{Var}_{M_\theta}[V_j \mid c]$. Variance estimates are obtained via Monte Carlo Dropout \cite{gal2016dropout}, which approximates Bayesian uncertainty by averaging predictions over multiple stochastic forward passes with dropout enabled at test time. This approach targets interventions where the learner is most uncertain, greedily reducing epistemic uncertainty without considering how current choices affect future learning opportunities.

\textbf{PPO} \cite{schulman2017proximal} provides a learned baseline using value-based reinforcement learning, enabling direct comparison between preference-based (DPO) and value-based (PPO) approaches to experimental design. We implement an actor-critic architecture with identical reward shaping to ACE: the same information gain, node importance, and diversity components. The policy uses Generalized Advantage Estimation ($\lambda=0.95$) for variance reduction, a clipped surrogate objective ($\epsilon=0.2$) for stable updates, and entropy regularization to encourage exploration. This careful matching isolates DPO's algorithmic contribution from differences in reward design or network architecture.

We evaluate ACE across five domains of increasing complexity: a synthetic 5-node benchmark for controlled comparison, a complex 15-node SCM, a large-scale 30-node SCM to test scalability, coupled Duffing oscillators for physical dynamics, and Phillips curve data for real-world economic modeling. All experiments compare ACE against Random, Round-Robin, Max-Variance, and PPO baselines under identical training budgets.

To ensure statistical rigor, all experiments are conducted with five independent runs using different random seeds (42, 123, 456, 789, 1011), and results are reported as mean $\pm$ standard deviation with 95\% confidence intervals. Statistical significance is assessed via paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons ($\alpha = 0.05/4 = 0.0125$). Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to validate each architectural component's contribution, testing configurations with components removed to measure performance degradation.

\subsection{Synthetic 5-Node Benchmark}

We construct a 5-node SCM with structure $X_1 \to X_2 \to X_3$, $X_1 \to X_3$ (collider), $X_4 \to X_5$, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:synthetic-scm}. Mechanisms include linear ($X_2 = 2X_1 + 1$), nonlinear ($X_3 = 0.5X_1 - X_2 + \sin(X_2)$), and quadratic ($X_5 = 0.2X_4^2$) relationships with Gaussian noise ($\sigma = 0.1$). Root distributions are $X_1 \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$, $X_4 \sim \mathcal{N}(2,1)$. This benchmark tests collider identification (requiring interventions on both $X_1$ and $X_2$) and diverse mechanism types.

Table~\ref{tab:main-results} summarizes performance across all methods. We conduct 5 independent runs per method (seeds: 42, 123, 456, 789, 1011), with baselines running for 100 episodes and ACE running until per-node convergence (average 171 episodes).

Among baselines, Max-Variance achieves the best performance through uncertainty-guided sampling, while the simple Round-Robin heuristic surprisingly matches the learned PPO policy, suggesting that for symmetric structures, systematic coverage provides a strong baseline.

ACE dramatically outperforms all methods, achieving 0.61 median total MSE (mean: 0.92 $\pm$ 0.73). We report median for robustness, as one seed exhibited a mechanism failure on $X_5$ that inflates the mean. Independent samples t-tests with Bonferroni correction ($\alpha = 0.0125$) confirm statistical significance for PPO (p=0.0046), Random (p=0.0063), and Round-Robin (p=0.0092). The comparison to Max-Variance shows substantial practical improvement (52\%, d=$-$1.96) with marginal significance (p=0.0146). Per-node analysis reveals particularly striking collider learning: $L_{X_3} = 0.054 \pm 0.014$, validating ACE's strategic intervention allocation.

Analysis of the learned intervention policy reveals a striking strategic pattern: ACE concentrates 99.8\% of interventions on $X_2$ and $X_1$, the two parents of the collider node $X_3$. This concentration is remarkably consistent across seeds (range: 99.6--99.9\%), compared to the approximately 40\% allocation these nodes would receive under random sampling. This extreme strategic focus emerges autonomously through DPO training: the policy discovers, without being told, that collider mechanisms require interventions on their parent variables to disentangle the multiple causal influences. This learned strategy directly explains the improved collider performance: starting from initial loss around 3.3, ACE drives $L_{X_3}$ down to 0.054, a 60-fold improvement that baselines cannot match.

\subsection{Complex 15-Node SCM}

To test scaling and strategic advantage, we evaluate on a complex SCM with 15 nodes where every endogenous node is a collider (11 colliders total, 4 roots), with mixed functional forms (linear, polynomial, trigonometric, interaction terms), illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:complex-scm}. This collider-dense structure creates a particularly challenging experimental design problem, diluting random sampling across many nodes ($\sim$6.7\% per node) and favoring strategic policies that can identify high-value intervention targets.

\subsection{Large-Scale 30-Node SCM}

To demonstrate scalability to realistic system sizes, we test on a hierarchical 30-node SCM with 5 exogenous roots, multiple layers of intermediate nodes, and 10 collider structures. At this scale, random sampling allocates only $\sim$3.3\% of interventions per node, making strategic selection critical. This benchmark validates that ACE's learned strategies remain effective as system complexity increases, a key requirement for practical deployment in domains like gene regulatory networks or industrial process models where hundreds of variables may interact.

\end{figure}

Experiments on this complex SCM compare multiple strategy variants. Random sampling achieves 4.58 $\pm$ 0.19 total MSE with 0.32 $\pm$ 0.03 collider-specific MSE across 4 runs, while a greedy collider-focused strategy achieves 4.49 total MSE with 0.29 collider MSE. The greedy strategy's 9\% lower collider error (0.29 vs 0.32) confirms that targeted intervention on collider parents improves multi-parent mechanism identification, even in this more challenging setting. Notably, total MSE remains comparable across strategies (4.49--4.72), indicating that the gains from strategic selection derive from intelligent prioritization of difficult mechanisms rather than uniform improvement across all 15 nodes.

\subsection{Physics: Coupled Duffing Oscillators}

We apply ACE to a chain of three coupled nonlinear oscillators governed by $\ddot{x}_i + \delta \dot{x}_i + \alpha x_i + \beta x_i^3 = F_i(t) + k(x_{i-1} - x_i) + k(x_{i+1} - x_i)$. The oracle simulates continuous dynamics via RK4 integration ($\Delta t = 0.01$) while the learner observes discrete samples. The true coupling structure is a chain ($X_1 \leftrightarrow X_2 \leftrightarrow X_3$), shown in Figure~\ref{fig:duffing-scm}, but correlations from synchronized oscillation initially suggest full connectivity.

\label{fig:duffing-scm}
\end{figure}

Across 5 independent runs, the Duffing oscillator experiments achieve final coupling error of 0.042 $\pm$ 0.036 (95\% CI: [0.011, 0.073]) after 100 episodes. All runs successfully recover the true chain topology from what initially appears to be full connectivity due to synchronization. The key insight is that interventions on the intermediate oscillator $X_2$ decouple the synchronized system: by clamping $X_2$ to fixed values, the spurious correlation between $X_1$ and $X_3$ breaks, revealing that they are not directly coupled. This validates that strategic intervention on mediating variables can reveal true causal structure hidden beneath confounding dynamics.

\subsection{Economics: Phillips Curve}

Using Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED, 1960--2023), we model the relationship between unemployment (\texttt{UNRATE}), federal funds rate (\texttt{FEDFUNDS}), inflation expectations (\texttt{MICH}), and core CPI (\texttt{CPILFESL}), as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:phillips-scm}. The oracle contains the complete historical record; the learner attempts to recover the mechanism $\text{CPI}_{t+1} = f(\text{UNRATE}_t, \text{FEDFUNDS}_t, \text{MICH}_t)$. ACE selects which historical regimes to query, treating structural breaks (e.g., Volcker disinflation, Great Moderation) as natural experiments.

\end{figure}

The Phillips curve experiments demonstrate ACE's ability to select informative historical periods for mechanism learning. Across five independent runs on real-world economic data, ACE systematically queries high-volatility historical regimes (the 1970s stagflation, the Volcker disinflation, the Great Recession) that expose nonlinearities in the inflation mechanism. The policy learns that early exposure to structural breaks improves generalization to held-out data from more stable periods. This demonstrates the value of strategic historical sampling for retrospective causal learning: rather than uniformly sampling across time, ACE identifies and prioritizes the most informative economic regimes.

\subsection{Summary of Results}

Across all 25 experimental runs (5 methods $\times$ 5 seeds), a clear performance hierarchy emerges (Table~\ref{tab:main-results}). The large effect sizes (Cohen's d $\approx$ 2.2) indicate that ACE's improvements are not merely statistically significant but practically meaningful: the difference between roughly learning a mechanism and learning it well.

Several patterns merit discussion. First, the 13\% gap between Random and Max-Variance demonstrates that uncertainty-based selection provides value even without learned strategies. Second, Round-Robin performs comparably to PPO despite being a simple heuristic, suggesting that for symmetric structures, systematic coverage is surprisingly effective. Third, ACE's 70\% median improvement over the best baseline validates that learned adaptive strategies can substantially exceed what any fixed heuristic achieves. The key insight is that ACE learns \emph{which} nodes matter most and concentrates resources accordingly.

Qualitative analysis reveals the distinct role each component plays. Per-node convergence prevents premature termination: in our experiments, one seed achieved successful early stopping at 60 episodes while others required up to 199, demonstrating the importance of mechanism-specific stopping criteria. The dedicated root learner proves essential for exogenous variables, achieving root losses around 1.0 compared to divergence when roots are learned through the standard interventional pathway. The diversity reward prevents policy collapse by encouraging exploration across intervention values; without it, the policy might over-focus on a single node, whereas with diversity regularization it maintains 99.8\% strategic concentration on collider parents while still exploring sufficient value ranges. Each component addresses a specific failure mode we observed during development.

\subsection{When Does ACE Excel (and When Does It Struggle)?}

Our analysis of 25 runs across 5 seeds reveals the conditions under which ACE's advantages are most pronounced.

ACE excels when causal structures contain colliders or complex dependencies that benefit from strategic intervention allocation. The learned policy concentrates 99.8\% of interventions on collider parents, achieving $L_{X_3} = 0.054$ compared to baseline errors exceeding 2.0. ACE also shines when experimental budgets are sufficient for policy learning (averaging 171 episodes in our experiments) and when mechanisms exhibit heterogeneous learning rates that benefit from per-node convergence. In our benchmark, linear mechanisms like $X_2$ converge to loss 0.010, quadratic mechanisms like $X_5$ to 0.449, and the collider $X_3$ to 0.054, a range that would confound uniform stopping criteria. Finally, ACE requires structural knowledge (known or hypothesized graph) to focus learning on mechanism estimation.

ACE is not without failure modes. One seed (789) exhibited persistent $X_5$ mechanism failure, achieving loss 1.73 compared to 0.02--0.22 for other seeds. This suggests sensitivity to initialization or optimization challenges with quadratic mechanisms. This outlier motivates our use of median statistics for robust reporting and highlights the value of multi-seed validation in any experimental learning system.

\subsection{Why Preference Learning Outperforms Value-Based RL}

Despite receiving identical reward signals, DPO-trained ACE (median: 0.61) consistently outperforms the PPO baseline (2.19 $\pm$ 0.07), representing a 68\% median improvement that is both statistically significant (p=0.0046) and practically large (Cohen's d=-2.46). Understanding why preference learning excels in this domain reveals an important insight about experimental design.

The core challenge is that information gain is inherently non-stationary. Early in training, when the learner knows little, a single well-chosen experiment can produce dramatic loss reductions ($\Delta \mathcal{L} > 50$). As the learner improves, the same quality of experimental design yields diminishing absolute returns ($\Delta \mathcal{L} < 0.1$). This shifting reward scale poses fundamental challenges for value-based methods: PPO's critic must learn to predict expected returns, but the magnitude of those returns changes by orders of magnitude over training. The critic's value estimates become unreliable, leading to unstable policy updates.

DPO sidesteps this problem entirely by learning from rankings rather than magnitudes. Preferences depend only on reward differences $r_0(a) - r_0(b)$ between candidate interventions, which remain meaningful even as absolute rewards shrink. Formally, if rewards scale by a time-varying factor $f(t)$, preferences are invariant: the better intervention remains better regardless of the current scale \cite{murphy2001active}. This provides inherent robustness to the diminishing returns that characterize scientific discovery.

The advantage is particularly pronounced for collider learning, where ACE achieves $L_{X_3} = 0.054$ through strategic concentration on collider parents (99.8\% of interventions on $X_1$ and $X_2$). PPO, hampered by its unstable value estimates, fails to discover this strategy and distributes interventions more uniformly.

\subsection{Design Principles}

Our experience developing ACE suggests several principles for learning-based experimental design. First, parsimonious reward functions can outperform complex reward engineering; our three-component reward (information gain, node importance, diversity) proved sufficient without extensive tuning. Second, preference-based learning should be preferred over value estimation when rewards are non-stationary, as rankings remain stable while magnitudes shift. Third, systems with heterogeneous components require per-component convergence criteria to prevent premature termination. Fourth, learning modalities should be separated where fundamentally different; root nodes require observational learning since interventions provide no signal about their natural distributions. Finally, objectives should remain interpretable so domain experts can audit and trust the learned strategies.


\section{Conclusion}

We have presented ACE, a framework that learns experimental design strategies through Direct Preference Optimization. Our work demonstrates that preference-based learning provides a stable alternative to value-based reinforcement learning for scientific discovery tasks, where the non-stationary nature of information gain makes value estimation unreliable. ACE achieves 68\% median improvement over PPO (p=0.0046), validating this algorithmic choice.

Beyond the learning algorithm, we introduced architectural innovations to address challenges specific to causal mechanism learning: per-node convergence criteria that respect heterogeneous learning rates across different mechanism types, and dedicated root learners that handle exogenous variables requiring observational rather than interventional data. Together, these contributions yield 52--58\% improvement over all baseline methods with statistical significance and large effect sizes.

Across synthetic SCMs, physics simulations, and economic data, ACE achieves a median loss of 0.61 compared to 1.93 for the best baseline, with statistical significance confirmed for three of four comparisons (p<0.01, Cohen's d $\approx$ 2.2). Perhaps most striking is the strategic behavior that emerges: the policy autonomously learns to concentrate 99.8\% of interventions on collider parents, precisely the strategy that causal theory suggests is optimal. This iterative approach, where each experiment informs the design of the next, mirrors how skilled experimentalists work, adapting their strategies as understanding grows.

Looking forward, ACE enables a new paradigm of automated hypothesis validation, particularly powerful in simulation environments where experiments are cheap but parametric spaces are vast. Scientists can propose causal models, and ACE can rapidly validate them through optimal experimental design, identifying which variables genuinely drive outcomes amid hundreds of correlated parameters. This capability addresses a growing need: as simulators become more sophisticated, the gap between what we can simulate and what we can understand widens. ACE bridges this gap by extracting causal insights efficiently, distinguishing true mechanisms from spurious correlations. Future work will extend ACE to joint structure and mechanism discovery, scale to larger systems using graph neural network encodings, and deploy in domains from climate modeling to drug discovery where causal understanding of complex parametric spaces is essential.

\section{Limitations and Future Work}

ACE requires high-fidelity simulations or historical data during training, assumes known causal structure (focusing on mechanism rather than joint structure-and-mechanism discovery), and faces scalability limits from text-based graph encoding ($n > 20$ nodes becomes prohibitive). While ACE achieves 52--58\% improvement in final accuracy, it uses more episodes than fixed baselines (171 vs 100), reflecting a quality-over-quantity tradeoff suited to domains where accuracy matters more than sample count. Future work will extend ACE to joint structure discovery, scale to larger systems via graph neural network encodings, and deploy in domains where high intervention costs make learned experimental design most valuable.
