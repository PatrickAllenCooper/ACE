## What We Have vs What We Need

### [DONE] Experiments: COMPLETE
- All 5 necessary experiments
- All verification scripts
- All extraction scripts

### [WARNING] Integration: INCOMPLETE
- Missing: Automated post-processing
- Missing: LaTeX table generation
- Missing: Automated claim verification report

### Required for Complete Workflow

**After run_all.sh completes, need:**

1. **scripts/process_all_results.sh** (automate everything)
2. **compare_methods.py --latex** (LaTeX table output)
3. **Automated verification report** (all claims [DONE] or [NO])

**Estimated effort:** ~6 hours to complete integration

## Conclusion

[DONE] **ALL EXPERIMENTS PRESENT**

We have every experiment needed to verify every paper claim:
- 5 jobs cover all sections
- Table 1 has all 5 methods
- All quantitative claims are verifiable
- All verification scripts exist

**What's missing:** Integration layer to automate results -> tables -> verified claims

**Bottom line:** Experiments are complete. Just need post-processing automation.
