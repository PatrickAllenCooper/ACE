ACE Failure Case Analysis
============================================================

Test Cases:
1. Normal 5-node (baseline)
2. Fully connected graph (challenging)
3. Symmetric ring (balanced structure)

Results:

Normal 5-node:
  Final Loss: 4.0899

Fully Connected:
  Final Loss: 5.2560
  vs Baseline: +28.5%

Symmetric Ring:
  Final Loss: 1.0885
  vs Baseline: -73.4%

Conclusions:
- Fully connected graphs show degradation (interventions can't isolate effects)
- Symmetric structures may favor round-robin over strategic allocation
- ACE's advantage depends on structural complexity and imbalance
